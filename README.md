# Traffic Sign Detection and Recognition System

This is a Bechalor Thesis Program of my final year thesis. It is written in python. 
Traffic Sign are detected by using opencv image segmentation with the method of Color based detection.
Detected Sign are recognized by using Convolutional Neural Netowrk.
This algorithm can be detected for real time scenario.
